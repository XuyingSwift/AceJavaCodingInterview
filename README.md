    - [Robot Room Cleaner] (https://leetcode.com/problems/robot-room-cleaner/)
        - Input: room = [[1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1],[1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1],[0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]], row = 1, col = 3
        - Output: Robot cleaned all rooms.
        - Explanation: All grids in the room are marked by either 0 or 1.0 means the cell is blocked, while 1 means the cell is accessible. The robot initially starts at the position of row=1, col=3. From the top left corner, its position is one row below and three columns right.

        - Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
        - Output: [[4,5,3],[2],[1]]
        - Explanation: [[3,5,4],[2],[1]] and [[3,4,5],[2],[1]] are also considered correct answers since per each level it does not matter the order on which elements are returned.
